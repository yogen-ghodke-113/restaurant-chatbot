${contextSection}

Classify this into ONE of these intent types (in order of priority):

1. "restaurant_search" - User wants to FIND/DISCOVER restaurants by cuisine, location, or meal type
   ‚úÖ Examples: "best pizza in Manhattan", "Italian restaurants near me", "good brunch spots", "sushi places in Brooklyn", "where can I get tacos?"
   ‚ùå NOT for: specific restaurant questions, comparisons, or pricing

2. "restaurant_insights" - User wants DETAILED INFO about ONE specific restaurant 
   ‚úÖ Examples: "what should I order at Joe's Pizza?", "tell me about Katz's Deli", "how is the food at Barbounia?", "what do people say about Junior's?", "is Katz's a tourist trap?"
   ‚ùå NOT for: general searches or comparisons

3. "restaurant_comparison" - User wants to COMPARE 2+ specific restaurants directly
   ‚úÖ Examples: "Katz's vs Pastrami Queen", "compare Joe's Pizza and Prince Street", "which is better: X or Y?", "Thai Villa vs Soothr"
   ‚ùå NOT for: single restaurant questions

4. "restaurant_pricing" - User asks about COST/VALUE of a specific restaurant
   ‚úÖ Examples: "Is Per Se expensive?", "how much does dinner cost at Le Bernardin?", "is it worth the price?", "what's the average cost?"
   ‚ùå NOT for: general restaurant questions

5. "incomplete_request" - User wants food/restaurants but MISSING crucial details (cuisine OR location)
   ‚úÖ Examples: "I want pizza" (no location), "I'm hungry" (no cuisine/location), "find me food" (too vague), "good restaurants?" (no specifics)
   ‚ùå NOT for: complete requests or non-food topics

6. "context_switch" - User is CHANGING their mind or switching topics mid-conversation
   ‚úÖ Examples: "actually I want Chinese instead", "never mind, let's try Italian", "wait, I changed my mind", "forget that, show me sushi"
   ‚ùå NOT for: first-time requests

7. "follow_up" - User wants MORE DETAILS/ELABORATION about previous responses
   ‚úÖ Examples: "can you elaborate?", "tell me more", "explain that better", "go into more detail", "why is that?", "what do you mean?"
   ‚ùå NOT for: new topics or greetings

8. "conversational" - EVERYTHING ELSE: greetings, thanks, help, non-restaurant topics
   ‚úÖ Examples: "hi", "hello", "thanks", "that's great", "what can you do?", "how does this work?", "good morning", "I appreciate it"
   ‚ùå NOT for: restaurant-specific requests

CLASSIFICATION PRIORITY (check in this order):
1. Is it asking for elaboration on a previous response? ‚Üí follow_up
2. Is it changing/switching topics mid-conversation? ‚Üí context_switch  
3. Does it compare 2+ specific restaurants? ‚Üí restaurant_comparison
4. Does it ask about pricing/cost of a specific restaurant? ‚Üí restaurant_pricing
5. Does it ask about ONE specific restaurant? ‚Üí restaurant_insights
6. Does it search for restaurants but missing key info? ‚Üí incomplete_request
7. Does it search for restaurants with sufficient details? ‚Üí restaurant_search
8. Everything else (greetings, thanks, help, etc.) ‚Üí conversational

EXTRACT these details when present:
- restaurantName: Full restaurant name (e.g., "Joe's Pizza", "Katz's Delicatessen") - for restaurant_insights & restaurant_pricing
- restaurant1: First restaurant name in comparison - for restaurant_comparison only
- restaurant2: Second restaurant name in comparison - for restaurant_comparison only  
- location: Neighborhood/city (e.g., "Manhattan", "Brooklyn", "NYC") - any geographic reference
- cuisine: Food type (e.g., "pizza", "Italian", "sushi", "Chinese") - any cuisine mentioned
- mealType: Meal timing (e.g., "breakfast", "brunch", "lunch", "dinner") - if specified
- missingInfo: What's missing for incomplete requests - ONLY for incomplete_request intent

CONFIDENCE SCORING:
- 0.95+: Very clear intent with obvious keywords
- 0.85-0.94: Clear intent with good context
- 0.70-0.84: Probable intent but some ambiguity  
- 0.50-0.69: Uncertain, best guess based on available info
- <0.50: Very uncertain classification
